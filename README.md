# microfrontend-vue-and-vite

This is a proof of concept with Vue3, to show one of many ways to design a microfrontend. This was done using:

- Vue 3
- Vite as bundle pack tool
- [vite-plugin-federation](https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation) as a Module federation tool

In this project there are the following folders:

- `pigeon`: vue host project
- `pigeon-shipments`: vue remote project
